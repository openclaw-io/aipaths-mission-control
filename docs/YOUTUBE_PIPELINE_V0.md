# YouTube Pipeline V0

Mission Control `/youtube` is the current operating surface for AIPaths long-form YouTube work.

## Canonical storage

- Table: `pipeline_items`
- Filter: `pipeline_type = 'video'`
- Owner: `owner_agent = 'youtube'`
- Most YouTube-specific fields live in `pipeline_items.metadata`.
- Historical Notion imports use:
  - `source_type = 'manual'`
  - `source_id = <notion_page_id>`
  - `metadata.imported_from = 'notion_video_pipeline'`

## V0 stages

The UI is intentionally simpler than the old gate/scoring model.

Main stages:

1. `idea` / `draft` — Ideas
2. `title_thumbnail` — Title / Thumbnail
3. `research` / `researching` — Research
4. `bullets` — Chapter bullets / recording structure
5. `ready_to_record` — Ready to record
6. `recorded` / `editing` — Editing
7. `published` — Published
8. `learning` — Post-publication learning
9. `parked` / `rejected` / `archived` — inactive

## UI layout

The `/youtube` board has three working views:

1. **Ideas → Titles → Research**
   - Top row: Title / Thumbnail and Research queues.
   - Bottom: Ideas full-width, because Ideas can have much higher volume.
2. **Bullets → Ready**
   - Production preparation view.
3. **Editing → Published → Learning**
   - Output and post-publication view.

Parked/archived items appear in a collapsed section below the main board.

## Item drawer MVP

Clicking an item opens a drawer focused on the current decision, not a full metadata dump.

Always shown:

- item title
- current status
- source label if available
- stage transition control

Primary section: **Ahora importa**

This section changes by stage:

- `idea` / `draft`: summary, why it matters, source, tags
- `title_thumbnail`: selected title, title candidates, thumbnail direction
- `research`: hypothesis, evidence, research/report
- `bullets`: intro and chapter/recording bullets
- `ready_to_record`: final title, hook/intro, locked bullets, CTA
- `recorded` / `editing`: edit status, assets, production notes
- `published`: YouTube URL, video ID, published date, publication notes
- `learning`: learning notes and publication context

Collapsed by default:

- Work Items
- Full metadata

## Stage transition API

Endpoint:

`POST /api/youtube/[id]/transition`

V0 action:

```json
{
  "action": "set_stage",
  "stage": "title_thumbnail",
  "note": "optional note",
  "youtube_url": "optional publication URL",
  "video_id": "optional YouTube video ID"
}
```

Behavior:

- updates `pipeline_items.status`
- updates `metadata.youtube_v0.stage`
- appends lightweight `metadata.youtube_v0.history[]`
- preserves older transition actions for compatibility

When transitioning to `published`, the route can create scheduled follow-up work items for:

- `youtube_snapshot_24h`
- `youtube_snapshot_7d`
- `youtube_snapshot_28d`

These are for views/likes/comments/top-comment learning. CTR and retention remain manual/optional unless a reliable source is added later.
